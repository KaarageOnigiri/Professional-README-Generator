# About
This is Module 9 Challenge by the Ohio State University bootcamp. This project is about letting the users create a professional README generator through command line node 'inquirer' library.

## Description
When the user initiate the the index.js file using the command line 'node index.js', there will be a series of prompts that the user will have to answer. Upon answering all the questions, a README file will be created in the 'output' folder. The license badge that the users choose will also appear at the top of the page.
